# The C Programming Language (Second Edition) by Kernighan, Brian W

Implementations of C Programming Exercises within the book of **  The C Programming Language (Second Edition) by Kernighan, Brian W **
A Repo to document and present my learning process with the C programming language. 

The author describe the language in neat and accurate ways making it very intuitive for self-taught learners, like myself, to follow.
I humbly appreciate the works and efforts the author - Dr. Kernighan - has dedicated in writing this masterpiece.
The most impressive part I found about this book is that the lively verbal diaglog style written can easily reminds you the impression and humourious tone of Dr. Kernighan. 
I heartly felt that this book has presented the beauty as well as the strict syntax of C can really offers you the control and comfort of logic that is paramount to Mathematics. 
A delightful read.
